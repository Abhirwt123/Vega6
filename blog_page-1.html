                            <p>History has shown humans tend to antagonize the unfamiliar. From Thomas Edison’s
                                ridiculed light bulb to the Wright Brothers’ mocked airplanes, well-meaning innovations
                                are no stranger to skepticism.

                                And history does repeat itself: Centuries later, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now the
                                subject of the very same mistrusting crowd.

                                From movies, video games and even to real-life news headlines, AI has always been
                                portrayed as an all-knowing, uncalloused, almighty being that will inevitably drive
                                humanity to irrelevancy.

                                When in reality, especially in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, AI has lifted
                                countless organizations from closing down, guided them to sounder business decisions
                                through data, and helped them produce more output with fewer resources through
                                automation.

                                Here are 8 myths about AI we need to unlearn right now:

                            <p>
                                Mostly thanks to pop culture, the fear of AI replacing humans has lingered in our
                                collective consciousness for the longest time. But when you think about it, AI is
                                merely a tool that ultimately needs to be operated on and modified by… you guessed
                                it, actual humans.

                                Stripped from the ultra-complex and cutting-edge technologies within it, AI is just
                                a machine like any other: A human invention designed to make life easier and
                                productivity a lot more potent.
                                After all, there’s no AI to operate on if it weren’t for the humans who conceived
                                it.

                                While it’s true that AI is, after all, just a string of 0s and 1s, it’s important to
                                remember that AI is only as objective—and subjective—as the humans who made and
                                improve upon it.

                                Remember, AI does not naturally occur in the wild. It requires data sets,
                                parameters, and rules that are inherently biased since human input can never be 100%
                                objective.

                                Additionally, implementing AI’s predictive analysis is usually not a one-layered
                                phase. It entails years and years of tweaking and patches to integrate new user data
                                and feedback, all with the goal of appropriately handling the dynamic and
                                often-evolving human decision-making.

                            <p>
                                Unless used medicinally, the worst AI can do when abandoned and left un-updated is
                                make obsolete and inaccurate decisions. Regardless of how many times we see it in
                                movies, it can’t suddenly learn sentience one day and catalyze a robot uprising.

                                While it’s technically true that AI can make decisions on its own, it still requires
                                human operation to feed it appropriate data, update its software, and eliminate
                                potential biases to make its predictive decisions more targeted to the problem.

                                So yes, you can stop watching over your gadgets at night now.

                                Sure, it may be the least of your priorities today, but the necessity for AI to
                                stand out from the competition, while keeping your operations functioning rain or
                                shine, is coming sooner rather than later.

                                You’d be surprised at how much of your day-to-day activities have some semblance of
                                AI integrated into it. Social media platforms’ deep-learning AI is one of the most
                                well-known among these, but judging from how it magically suggests just the right
                                content for you consistently, you probably would have guessed that by now.

                                But seriously, AI integration can range from something as trifle as your phone
                                predicting your sleep pattern or Amazon recommending items you’d most likely click
                                on, to utilization so essential you can’t help but feel grateful for AI.

                                These include automobile features that proactively seek out potential road hazards,
                                detecting fraud on your bank accounts, weather prediction for agriculture, and even
                                making society more accessible for differently-abled folks.

                                If having AI omnipresent means I get to live in an all-inclusive, convenient, and
                                efficient world, then count me right in.

                                Let’s be real, data privacy and security concerns are becoming more real by the
                                minute. And who wouldn’t be worried? With systems designed to take your data and
                                predict what you do next, how futile can our resistance be?

                                What if I tell you there are already AI systems specifically designed to let you
                                thoroughly comprehend and review the content before clicking that “Agree” button on
                                the Terms and Conditions?

                                Like any other powerful tool, AI can be used for the better or for underhanded
                                tactics. Rather than shoot the messenger, why not hold accountable those people who
                                design AI for adversity?

                                Although it’s easy to think that AI is a cutting-edge innovation fresh out of the
                                oven, history would tell you otherwise. In fact, its origins can be traced back to
                                World War II where machine learning’s foundations were laid.

                                It wasn’t until years later that hardware caught up with software and that AI, as we
                                know it today, came to life.

                                So if your trust in this technology is stifled by the fact that it’s still on its
                                alpha stage, think again. Decades upon decades of blood, sweat, and brain cells of
                                countless people have been spent to get AI to the impressive stage where it’s at
                                now.

                                If there’s anything the COVID-19 pandemic brought to light, it’s the importance of
                                business continuity. Seriously, no business owner worth their salt would be caught
                                without a contingency plan should operations go south. And this is where AI can
                                really shine.

                                If one of technology’s ultimate goal is to eliminate scarcity, then AI complements
                                this by letting humans make the most out of our limited resources. Optimized,
                                ever-running operations? It’s every business owner’s utopia.

                                The sooner we embrace AI, the better. This is because it supports the three pillars
                                that modern-day businesses need to get ahead: data insight, automation, and
                                engagement.

                                It doesn’t matter if you’re a well-established institution or a startup business run
                                solely by a person, leveraging on AI’s capabilities to guide you through your
                                business decisions, pursue leads, and streamline your processes bring about
                                priceless benefits any business can only have more of.


                                We get it, AI is so vast you won’t even know where to begin diving in. And maybe
                                that same barrier of unfamiliarity is what’s stopping most of us from fully
                                appreciating the power of AI.

                                But chances are, you have already experienced the beauty of AI yourself, even
                                without you noticing it—from ordering your food a minute faster, being literally
                                saved by your car’s smart features, or maybe even getting instant customer support
                                assistance.

                                AI is one of humanity’s greatest technological leaps. Countless industries have
                                already made the leap of faith and are now reaping the benefits of AI, so what’s
                                stopping you?
