                            Work Smart, Not Hard: 5 Tips on Creating your Workplace Legacy

                            <p>

                                Legacy is such a big word. Most of us, especially young professionals fresh out of
                                college, don’t even know where to start our journey towards imprinting a lasting,
                                lifetime legacy within the organization.

                                But when you think about it, you most likely don’t remember who initiated automating
                                your company processes, or who held the all-time highest sales figure in the company.

                                Rather, the ones you remember are those who consistently lent you a hand during project
                                crunch times, or those who patiently answered your queries during team meetings.

                                Sure, organizational legacies are nothing short of impressive. But fostering a culture
                                of productivity and upping the workplace benchmark? That’s what modern legends are all
                                about.

                                Here are five tips on how you can begin your journey towards corporate prominence:

                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="blog-sub-head">
                            <h1>1. Be remembered.</h1>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog-sub-content">

                            <p>
                                You can’t build a legacy without people remembering you. Very much like the concept of
                                selling yourself, an unwavering, consistent, and solid branding is your key to being
                                remembered by your teammates, clients, and stakeholders
                                or remembered with an actual impressive title like the Excel Wizard or the Office Oracle
                                is completely up to your skills, smarts, and how you play your cards.

                                The bottom line: make yourself indispensable to the team, and ultimately to the whole
                                company, through a solid branding that is unmistakably and uniquely yours.



                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="blog-sub-head">
                            <h2>2. Observe the tasks you grumble about.
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog-sub-content">

                            <p>
                                Have you ever been tasked with something so menial you can’t help but wish for robots to
                                replace you right there and then? Chances are, these grumble-worthy tasks are the
                                process gaps your team can improve on.

                                If you’re looking for a much more concrete legacy to leave, streamlining is one of your
                                biggest allies. After a much-needed grumbling, it helps to think what improvements can
                                be made to optimize the processes currently in place within the organization.

                                Of course, inspiration without action is merely entertainment. Formulate a plan on how
                                to best approach the subject or how to formally escalate this to your superiors.

                            </p>

                                3. Put your faith in technology.

                                Especially effective in organizations still clinging to old-fashioned, manual labor,
                                familiarizing yourself with automation and online collaboration tools will not only put
                                you in a good light but overall make life easier for your team and clients as well.

                                Win-win, right? Well, it helps to also ease your teammates into the transition first.
                                Keep in mind that people tend to reject the unfamiliar. A smooth transition helps them
                                get to know the innovation and, if the stars are aligned, to actually grow an
                                appreciation for it.

                                Coincidentally, leading by example works not only for children but for full-grown adults
                                as well. One tested way to know how to create a legacy within the workplace is to
                                observe someone who has actually done it – not to retrace their steps, but to take
                                inspiration from their decision-making.

                                How did their initiative begin? Where did they even get the idea of shaking things up?
                                And most importantly, what supporting actions have they done to enforce this change
                                within the organization?

                                Whether it be through networking to win over colleagues, persistent campaigning and
                                awareness drives to promote the innovation, or directly through mandating the new
                                process, it helps to see what went right and what went wrong from those who have treaded
                                the path before you.

                            <p>
                                The harsh reality is that it is not enough to excel during your time at work. Sure,
                                you’ll be remembered by your immediate teammates and maybe even your boss, but what
                                happens after their time in the workplace?

                                Your contributions should ideally ripple beyond your immediate environment. It doesn’t
                                have to be something grand or complex, it can be simple yet meaningful gestures that
                                surpass your time and reach in the organization.

                                For instance, coaching your teammates on a certain skillset you excel at not only boosts
                                your relevance to the organization but also makes the team more efficient for
                                stakeholders to work with. This way, your presence can still be felt long after your
                                time in the company.<br>
                                But as with all great things, planning ahead and strategizing heightens your probability
                                of success. The best way to create your workplace legacy is to prepare for it while
                                you’re still working. Doing this not only boosts your performance but inspires your
                                teammates as well.

                                Lastly, keep in mind: Legacies don’t happen overnight. It most certainly doesn’t come
                                served on a silver platter. It requires persistent effort, consistent performance, and
                                heaps of patience not only for those around you but for your personal development as
                                well.
