                            <p>A job is more than a paycheck.

                                You spend half of your waking life on it (or sometimes even more), you get to interact
                                with the same set of people 5 days of the week, and it demands your full, undivided
                                dedication and attention. Not to mention you most likely will do this for several years.

                                So when choosing one, it’s crucial to observe the workplace culture to determine whether
                                the next few years of your life will actually be one of growth and enjoyable challenges,
                                or one full of dread and regrets.

                                No, the night-and-day comparison is not an exaggeration. You may be at a point right now
                                where your bills and responsibilities take precedence, so office culture and growth mean
                                little. And as someone who lives in reality, that’s okay. But there will come a point
                                where you have to ask yourself, “Is this the office culture I’m willing to let go of my
                                wellbeing for?”

                                To help you decide, here are 6 signs you work for a company that takes care of its
                                employees:

                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="blog-sub-head">
                            <h2>
                                1.The management listens to new ideas and feedback

                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog-sub-content">

                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, a lot of big-name, established institutions fall into the trap of
                                complacency. What values and strategies brought them to the top decades ago are still
                                well in place even when a new generation of consumers—and workers—are now in place.

                                So when your company encourages its employees to share their process innovations,
                                feedback, and techniques, consider it a blessing. Not many are lucky to have their
                                voices heard throughout the organization.

                                Here’s the catch though: It also helps to observe which feedback and recommendations are
                                listened to. It may be that the management does listen—but to select folks only.
                                Hierarchy or management level is also a factor you have to take notice of when your
                                company solicits a review.

                                How would I know this? For smaller teams, a regular group or one-one-session session
                                wherein your ideas and feedback are explored are held. For large organizations however,
                                a company-wide survey is usually held in place.


                            </p>
                        </div>



                        <div class="blog-sub-head">
                            <h2> 2.Smiles are not a scarcity

                        <div class="blog-sub-content">

                            <p>
                                Just like homes, the office vibe is usually a telling sign of how the company operates.
                                If it’s relaxed, light, and filled with vibrant conversations, chances are the employees
                                within it feel at ease and comfortable working.

                                Aside from emotional benefits, happy employees are also productive employees according
                                to a 2019 research by Oxford University's Saïd Business School. So not only are you
                                surrounded by an environment that makes your workload easier to handle, you’re also
                                around people who are scientifically proven to do more.

                                And it’s true what they say, “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” If your
                                office culture treats its employees like machines who can be 100% on work mode, and not
                                actual humans who need time for personal welfare, then maybe it’s time to consider
                                looking for an employer who can treat you better.

                                <strong> How would I know this?</strong> It’s a sign that your company sees you more
                                than merely a
                                money-making machine when they occasionally shake things up and organize fun events.
                                Take notice if the management tries to keep its people engaged. It doesn’t have to be
                                grandiose—a simple team lunch-out or even a virtual friendly competition can do the
                                trick.

                                Hiring employees is easy, lots of people need jobs. But earning the loyalty of your
                                people? That’s an entirely new topic.

                                When employees feel job-secure, well-compensated, and generally in an environment that
                                lets them grow, chances are they can stay with that company longer.

                                <strong> How would I know this?</strong> Take notice if there are company initiatives to
                                keep workers from
                                being stale in terms of growth and experience, whether it be training, educational
                                grants, or maybe even special schedule arrangements to accommodate your external
                                courses.

                                On the flip side, if you notice bored and unchallenged employees, chances are the
                                organization isn’t as invested in their growth as you hope they’d be.

                                Although low employee turnover is great, also take caution on environments filled with
                                people who have been stuck doing the same stuff five 5 days a week for so many years.

                                It’s not enough that employees stay, it’s also important what the company does for the
                                people who do.

                                For instance, upskilling workers is one of the surefire ways of ensuring they
                                continuously grow even when they’re staying with the same organization. And it doesn’t
                                have to be super official, complete with certifications (although we wouldn’t say no to
                                that!), or a paid instructor.

                                It can be as simple as intercompany refresher courses on basic office skills such as
                                spreadsheets, word processing software, or as straightforward as business writing
                                training.

                                It can also be in a form of work rotation, just to keep it fresh for the workers while
                                also letting them know the organization better through exploration and immersion outside
                                their usual environment.

                                The best companies to work for are those who are as interested in driving your value as
                                you are in boosting theirs. After all, an organization is only as good as its individual
                                members.

                                5. They prefer the carrot to the stick

                                Another strong sign that an organization has its employees’ welfare in mind is
                                implementing positive reinforcement as the norm.

                                Gone are the days of being penalized for not reaching your quota. Nowadays, those who
                                exceed the company benchmark are rewarded extra for delivering beyond their goals.

                                Not to say that refractions are unacceptable now, there are still some cases where
                                they’re appropriate. But when your management leans towards motivating you through
                                worthwhile and appealing rewards, one can’t help but return the kindness with dedication
                                and loyalty.

                                An organization that truly has your welfare in mind works with you, and not against
                                you.<br>

                                <strong> How would I know this?</strong> You can usually tell a company’s values by the
                                consequences of
                                the key performance indicators it imposes. For instance, does it reward top-performing
                                employees or would it rather demote those who are not doing so well?




                            </p>
                        </div>


                        <div class="blog-sub-head">
                            <h2>

                                6. Your efforts are recognized


                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog-sub-content">

                            <p>

                                As simple as it may seem, there’s no denying the power of recognition and appreciation
                                especially in a professional setting.
                                You can be at a lucrative-paying job, or be surrounded by the most engaging company
                                activities, but without an occasional tap on the back for a job well done, it’s hard not
                                to feel disregarded and unvalued.

                                No need for a full fanfare, even quick gestures go a long way in keeping an employee
                                happy, motivated, and engaged. Seriously, who doesn’t like a little validation now and
                                then?<br>


                                <strong> How would I know this?</strong>You can tell workers feel valued when they
                                actively take part in
                                the culture of appreciation themselves. You often hear “Great job”s or “You did great”s
                                exchanged and teammates are genuinely proud of their peer’s achievements.

                                Not to worry if these all still sound unrealistic to you. Finding the perfect workplace
                                really does take a lot of time, patience, and maybe a little bit of luck too.

                                Never say never though. While it may be true that finding a job that keeps you happy is
                                hard to come by—and finding a company that takes care of you (financially and beyond) is
                                something a lot rarer, it’s all going to be so worth it when you finally do.
